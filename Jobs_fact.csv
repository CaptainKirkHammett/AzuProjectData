Sign in Report this job Job Description Data at Wolt As the scale of Wolt has rapidly grown, we are introducing new users to our data platform every day and want this to become a coherent and streamlined experience for all users, whether they‚Äôre Analysts, Data Scientists working with our data or teams bringing new data to the platform from their applications. We aim to both provide new platform capabilities across batch, streaming, orchestration and data integration to serve our user‚Äôs needs, as well as building an intuitive interface for them to solve their use cases without having to learn the details of the underlying tools. In the context of this role we are hiring an experienced Software Engineer to provide in one the following workstreams Data Governance Wolt‚Äôs Data Group has already developed an initial foundational tooling in the areas of data management, security, auditing, data catalog and quality monitoring, but through your technical contributions you will ensure our Data Governance tooling is state of the art. You‚Äôll be improving the current Data Governance platform, making sure it can be further integrated with the rest of the Data Platform and Wolt Services in a scalable, secure, compliant way, without significant disruptions to the teams. Data Experience We want to ensure our Analysts, Data Scientists, and Engineers can discover, understand, and publish high-quality data at scale. We have recently released a new data platform tool which enables simple, yet powerful creation of workflows via a declarative interface. You will help us ensure our users succeed in their work with effective and polished user experiences by developing our internal user-facing tooling and curating our documentation to the highest standards. And what's best, you get to work closely with excited users to get continuous feedback about released features while supporting and onboarding them to new workflows. Experimentation We build and maintain our internal experimentation platform, Regatta, which supports A/B testing across the whole organization. We keep on expanding the capabilities of our platform, work in areas such as experiment distribution, analysis and on the front end used by our colleagues around the world. In this workstream you will be improving our current platform and work on our next generation experimentation experience. At the time you‚Äôll join we‚Äôll match you with one of these work streams based on our needs and your skills, experience and preferences. How We Work Our teams have a lot of autonomy and ownership in how they work and solve their challenges. We value collaboration, learning from each other and helping each other out to achieve the team‚Äôs goals. We create an environment of trust, in which everyone‚Äôs ideas are heard and where we challenge each other to find the best solutions. We have empathy towards our users and other teams. Even though we‚Äôre working in a mostly remote environment these days, we stay connected and don‚Äôt forget to have fun together building great software! Our tech stack Our primary programming language of choice is Python. We deploy our systems in Kubernetes and AWS. We use Datadog for observability (logging and metrics). We have built our data warehouse on top of Snowflake and orchestrate our batch processes with Dagster. We are heavy users of Kafka and Kafka Connect. Our CI/CD pipelines rely on GitHub actions and Argo Workflows. üìçThis role can be based in one of our tech hubs in Helsinki, Berlin or Stockholm, or you can work remotely anywhere in Finland, Sweden, Germany. Read more about our remote setup here. Our humble expectations Our humble expectations The vast majority of our services, applications and data pipelines are written in Python, so several years of having shipped production quality software in high throughput environments written in Python is essential. You should be very comfortable with typing, dependency management, unit-, integration- and end-to-end tests. If you believe that software isn‚Äôt just a program running on a machine, but the solution to someone‚Äôs problem, you‚Äôre in the right place. Having previous experience in executing complex projects that touch multiple teams/stakeholders and run across a whole organization is a big plus. Good communication and collaboration skills are essential, and you shouldn‚Äôt shy away from problems, but be able to discuss them in a constructive way with your team and the Wolt Product team at large. Familiarity with parts of our tech stack is definitely a plus, but we hire for attitude and ability to learn over knowing a specific technology that can be learned. The tools we are building inside of the data platform ultimately serve our many stakeholders across the whole company, whether they are Analysts, Data Scientists or engineers in other teams that produce or consume data. We want all of our users to love the tools we‚Äôre building and that is why we want you to focus on building intuitive and user friendly applications that enable everyone to use and work with data at Wolt. Next Steps The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us! The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you‚Äôll own a piece of the pie.

Emme silti odota sinun tiet√§v√§n ja osaavan kaikkea, mutta odotamme ett√§ sinulla on vahva intohimo oppia ja kehitt√§√§ uutta. Sinulla on kokemusta tiedonhallinnan kokonaisuuksien ja toimintamallien konseptoinnista, kehitt√§misest√§ ja selke√§st√§ dokumentoinnista. Viestit asiantuntevasti ja ymm√§rrett√§v√§sti tiedonhallinnasta eri sidosryhmille ja osaat vakuuttavasti oivalluttaa, miksi sit√§ tehd√§√§n. Osaat my√∂s taitavasti ja luotettavasti arvioida tiedonhallinnalle asetettujen vaatimusten ja standardien toteutumista eri kohdealueilla sek√§ argumentoida rakentavasti ja selke√§sti perustellen tarvittavista korjaavista toimenpiteist√§ hyv√§n tiedonhallinnan vaatimusten t√§ytt√§miseksi.
